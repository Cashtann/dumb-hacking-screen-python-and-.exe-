This is really dump app, one of my firsts. There is a lot of trash code, but it works :)
You have to download couple of libraries, and also compile it to .exe file.

Don't worry if you see some spaghetti code, it works, and the 1st programming rule is "if it works, don't touch it".

I hope you enjoy, you can remake this code for your own and troll your friends
